/**
 * Which guide explains which Preferences section — and back.
 *
 * Preferences shows *what can be set*; the guides explain *what it means and
 * when to touch it*. They used to be joined by three hand-written "full guide"
 * links (MCP, Pulse, one inside Connections), which is how the other sections
 * ended up with nothing: a link only exists where someone remembered to write
 * it. One table makes the join a property of the section, so the header button
 * appears wherever a row is added here and a test can say which sections have no
 * guide instead of it being a thing nobody knows.
 *
 * `headingKey` is an i18n key whose **text is a heading in the guide** — not a
 * slug, because slugs are per language (`connection-limits` is
 * `límites-de-conexiones` in Spanish) — resolved through `docLocation` against
 * the body the viewer will actually show. A test resolves every one in both
 * languages, so a renamed heading fails the build rather than quietly dropping
 * the reader on the cover.
