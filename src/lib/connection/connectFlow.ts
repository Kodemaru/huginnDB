 * have been a fourth copy. The older call sites — `FileMenu`, `StatusConnections`
 * and `CommandPalette` — still carry their own inlined versions; two are
 * behaviourally identical to this and one (`FileMenu`) reports failures through
 * `alert` instead of a toast. Consolidating them is a separate cleanup, not
 * something to fold into a feature commit.
 *
 * Deliberately store-level rather than a hook: it's called from click handlers,

/**
 * Close every live pool, concurrently.
 *
 * **Why this is one function and not two loops.** "Disconnect all" had two
 * implementations that disagreed on both axes that matter. The connections
 * tree awaited each connection in turn *and* cleaned up after each (schema
 * cache, tabs); the keyboard shortcut and the command palette fired them all
 * off with `void` *and* cleaned up neither, leaving a stale tree and tabs
 * pointing at closed pools. So the same command was slow and correct from one
 * surface, fast and lossy from another.
 *
 * **Why concurrency is the fix rather than a nicety.** A single disconnect is
 * not one round trip: the backend closes each synthetic `<parent>::db::<db>`
 * pool in turn — every one of them up to `CLOSE_TIMEOUT` (5s) if the server
 * has stopped answering — before closing the parent's, and the frontend
 * flushes one tab-state snapshot per child on top of that. Serialising the
 * *connections* on top of all that nesting is what turned "disconnect all"
 * into a visible wait, and one unreachable server made every healthy one
 * behind it wait out its timeout first. `allSettled`, not `all`: one pool that
 * refuses to close must not abandon the rest half-torn-down.
 *
 * The launch-state write is suppressed per connection and done once at the
 * end — see `useConnections.disconnect`'s `persistLaunch` for the race that
 * otherwise makes the *last* of N concurrent writes the winner.
