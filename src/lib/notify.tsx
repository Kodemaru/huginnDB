/**
 * Raising a notification. The one entry point — nothing outside this module
 * imports `sonner` any more.
 *
 * The split is deliberate: **Sonner is the transport, the surface is ours.**
 * It keeps the stack (positions, gaps, swipe, focus, timers) and, because a
 * `jsx` toast is flagged `data-styled="false"`, paints none of it — so
 * `NotificationCard` and `NotificationPill` own the surface and the ~60 lines
 * of `!important` that used to fight the library's hardcoded white card are
 * gone.
 *
 * There *are* two hosts now, which an earlier version of this comment said
 * there would never be: the six positions being a `<Toaster>` prop made the
 * whole layout half of the preferences configuration rather than a container,
 * and that is still true — what changed is that a one-line pill and a 380px
 * card want different corners, and Sonner routes that natively (`<Toaster id>`
 * plus `toasterId` per toast) rather than needing a host of our own. Pointing
 * both at the same corner mounts one again.
 *
 * Four behaviours live here rather than at the call sites, because they are
 * policy and not decoration:
 *
 * * **Anatomy.** {@link surfaceFor} decides card or pill, once, from what the
 *   notification carries rather than from what kind it is. A call site that
 *   had to remember would be one that silently dropped its own buttons.
 * * **Duration.** The base is `notifications.durationMs` (6 s, up from the
 *   library's 4 s, which was not long enough to read a path or a driver error).
 *   Kinds that carry something to act on get a multiple of it, and an error
 *   waits to be dismissed when `errorsPersist` is on.
 * * **Grouping.** A burst of identical notifications — a multi-row save, a
 *   loop — is one card with a counter instead of seven cards. The key defaults
 *   to kind + title, so no call site had to opt in.
 * * **History.** Every notification is recorded for the bell
 *   (`stores/notifications.ts`) as it is raised. That is what makes short
 *   toasts acceptable: nothing is lost by missing one.
 *
 * Grouping state lives *here* and the store only records the decision, so the
 * screen and the history can never disagree about what counts as a repeat.
