/**
 * Adoption budgets for the component library — a ratchet, not a contract.
 *
 * `uiContracts.test.ts` states its own design rule at the top: a rule belongs
 * there only if its allowlist *can* be empty, because "one that needs
 * exceptions is a matter of taste". That rule is right and this file does not
 * bend it — it answers a different question. A contract says *this is a bug*.
 * A budget says *this is debt, and it may only shrink*. Two of the patterns the
 * primitives were built to replace have a hundred-plus call sites that predate
 * them, so they cannot be contracts today and would be lost as TODO comments if
 * they were left as prose. They are counted here instead.
 *
 * Note that `uiContracts.test.ts` explicitly *rejected* "ban native `title=`"
 * on exactly these grounds. This file is the answer to that rejection, not a
 * reversal of it: the ban is still not a contract, and the count is.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * Each rule owns a map of `path -> count` seeded with today's real number, and
 * asserts the measured map equals it **exactly**. That is deliberate in both
 * directions:
 *
 * - Adding one fails the build. Debt cannot grow quietly.
 * - Removing one *also* fails, asking for the number to come down. A cleanup
 *   then shows up in the diff as `6` → `5` next to the change that earned it,
 *   which is the point: progress is legible in the history rather than being
 *   something you have to go and measure.
 *
 * The maps are sorted by debt descending, so each one doubles as a worklist in
 * priority order. Per file rather than per domain on purpose — a per-domain
 * total would let a new button in one file hide behind a deletion in its
 * neighbour, and the file-level number is what tells you whether a migration
 * finished a file or only visited it.
 *
 * ## How it ends
 *
 * A rule's budget reaching `{}` is the signal to move it into
 * `uiContracts.test.ts` as a real contract with an empty allowlist, and delete
 * it here. When both are gone, so is this file. If a count instead stalls above
 * zero because the remaining call sites are genuinely correct, that is not a
 * failure either — write the reason next to the entry and it becomes a
 * documented exception, which is more than the prose it replaced ever was.

  /**
   * `IconButton` and `Button` exist so that a control's height, hover alpha,
   * focus ring and disabled treatment are decided once. Before them the app
   * had four hover alphas and three paddings across visually identical
   * buttons, and that is what the elements still counted here are: each one
   * re-decides, in isolation, something the primitives already answer.
   *
   * Two examples of what the count is actually measuring, both found while
   * seeding it. `ConnectionsTree`'s "disconnect all" is a hand-rolled button
   * with `text-muted-foreground`, so the app's most destructive tree action
   * reads exactly like the refresh button beside it — while `IconButton`
   * already ships `tone="destructive"`, the API it wanted. `CellInput`'s
   * expand button paints an opaque `bg-background` patch (it has to; it is
   * `sticky`) resolved against a flat cell, which is the hairline seam that
   * shows when the cell underneath is focused and tinted.
   *
   * Counted as elements, not files: a file is not migrated until its last one
   * is gone, and only a per-element count can say how far in it is.
   *
   * **Not every entry is migratable, and `DocumentListView` is the worked
   * example.** Of its six, exactly one was chrome (the draft card's cancel) and
   * became an `IconButton`. The rest cannot, for two reasons worth writing down
   * before someone forces them through to make a number go down:
   *
   * - Three are not icon buttons at all. They render a glyph or a word — `∅`,
   *   the field's type name, "save" — and `IconButton` takes a `LucideIcon`.
   * - Two are inline affordances inside a field row, which is a flex line of
   *   monospace text at `leading-relaxed` whose `fontSize` is driven by the
   *   grid's Ctrl+wheel zoom. `IconButton`'s smallest shape is a fixed
   *   `h-6 w-6`; dropping one into that line pins the row height and **breaks
   *   the zoom**. The app has a real class of text-level actions that sit below
   *   the primitive layer's density floor, and the honest answer is that they
   *   are not buttons in the chrome sense rather than that `ui/` needs a
   *   sub-24px icon shape.
   *
   * So this budget stalls above zero, which is the case the header describes:
   * the reason lives next to the entry and the rule never graduates to a
   * contract. A number that would only go to zero by making the list view worse
   * is a number to stop pushing on.

   * A native `title=` is the operating system's tooltip: its own delay, its own
   * look, no theme, and no coordination with the app's. `IconButton` omits
   * `title` from its props type to make that a compile error, and
   * `uiContracts.test.ts`'s rule H catches a `<Button size="icon" title=>`.
   * Neither reaches the ones counted here.
   *
   * Rule H's shape is why: it fires only on `size="icon"`, so
   * `GridToolbar.tsx`'s `<Button size="sm" title={t("dataGrid.insertNewRow")}>`
   * — a labelled button showing an OS tooltip in the grid's main toolbar —
   * passes it cleanly. Widening rule H is not the fix, because a contract with
   * dozens of violations cannot be merged; counting them is.
   *
   * **What counts.** A `title` that reaches the DOM: any lowercase (host) tag,
   * plus `Button` / `Switch` / `SelectTrigger`, which spread their props onto
   * one. A `title` prop on a component that renders it as *copy* — the heading
   * of `EmptyState`, `Panel`, `Section`, `NamePromptDialog`, `ConfirmDialog`,
   * `OverlayPalette` — is not a tooltip and is not counted; there were 43 of
   * those, and a rule that swept them in would be measuring nothing.
   *
   * **What is deliberately exempt.** `DropdownMenuItem` and `ContextMenuItem`.
   * `tooltip.tsx` documents the one place the OS tooltip is the correct choice:
   * inside open menu content, where a Radix tooltip fights the menu's own hover
   * and portal handling. Those are not debt, so they are not in the budget —
   * this is the "documented exception" the header describes, and it is why this
   * rule could not have been written as a contract even with the migration
   * finished.
   *
   * **Why the headline went from 47 to 72.** Not because debt grew — no
   * `title=` was added to get there. The first version of this rule found
   * tags with a regex that ended a tag at its first `>`, and in
   * `<button onClick={() => …} title=…>` that is the `>` of the arrow, so any
   * `title` written after an inline handler (or after a `a > b` inside a
   * `className={cn(…)}`) was never seen. `openingTags` walks the attribute
   * list instead, and the 25 elements it added were all there before it:
   * the grid's pin-column toggle, the query editor's Run / Save / History
   * buttons, the Pulse EXPLAIN toggle, and so on. The rule got more accurate;
   * the old number was an undercount, not a better score.
