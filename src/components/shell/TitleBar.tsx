/**
 * The one bar at the top of every window: HuginnDB's own chrome and the OS
 * window controls in a single 36px row, the way Claude Desktop or VS Code do
 * it, instead of the native title bar stacked on top of the app's menu bar.
 *
 * The native frame is turned off in the backend (`window_chrome.rs`), so
 * everything the title bar used to give for free is rebuilt here:
 *
 * - **Dragging.** `data-tauri-drag-region` on the `<header>`. Tauri only starts
 *   a drag when the pointer lands on the element *carrying* the attribute, not
 *   on its descendants, so empty stretches of the bar drag and buttons stay
 *   clickable without any per-child opt-out. That is also why a caller's
 *   decorative content (the breadcrumb, a window title) must be
 *   `pointer-events-none`: the press then falls through to the header. A
 *   double-click on the same region toggles maximise — Tauri's drag script
 *   handles that too (`core:window:allow-internal-toggle-maximize`).
 * - **Minimise / maximise / close.** `WindowControls` below. `close()` raises
 *   `CloseRequested` exactly like the native ✕ did, so the main window's
 *   flush-before-exit in `App.tsx` still runs.
 * - **Resizing** needs nothing here: an undecorated Windows window keeps its
 *   DWM shadow, and the resize borders live in it, outside the client area.
 *
 * No Snap Layouts flyout on hover over maximise: Windows only draws it for a
 * button it recognises as its own, which a button inside a webview is not.
 * The one plugin that claims it (`tauri-plugin-decorum`) fakes it by typing
 * Win+Z and then Alt through `SendInput`, which we declined. Win+Z, Win+arrows
 * and dragging to the top of the screen still snap as usual.
 *
 * macOS keeps its native frame (`usesNativeFrame`): its traffic lights sit on
 * the left, the platform is unverified here, and a half-done overlay is worse
 * than the bar it replaced. There the component is just the app's menu bar.
