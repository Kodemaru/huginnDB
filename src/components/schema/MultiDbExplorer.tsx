/**
 * Multi-DB explorer — for a profile whose `database` is blank. Lists every
 * database the user can see on the server as a top-level node; expanding one
 * lazily opens a synthetic `<parent>::db::<name>` connection
 * (`open_database_view`) and the nested subtree is a regular
 * `SingleDbExplorer` pointed at that synthetic id.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing and documented at the site as well:
 *
 * - **Nothing here opens a connection pool on its own.** The cross-database
 *   search prefetch that used to live in this file is gone; warming is an
 *   explicit action on the filter box (`lib/schema/warmForSearch.ts`).
 * - **The `useMemo`s stay above the `if (!cs)` early return**, for the same
 *   hook-count reason `SingleDbExplorer`'s header spells out.
 *
 * **This file no longer owns any part of the search.** It used to debounce the
 * needle itself, compute its own match set over a wide `byConnection`
 * subscription, and keep a hidden second scope (`activeDatabaseName`, set as a
 * side effect of expanding a database). All three now live in the tree: the
 * needle is committed once, counted once, and arrives here already parsed
 * (`patterns`) alongside this connection's `summary`.
