//! Per-server connection budgets.
//!
//! Everything up to 1.13.0 accounted for connections **per profile**: each
//! saved connection got its own ceiling, and each per-database view got its
//! own on top. Nothing anywhere could answer the only question that actually
//! matters to a server — *how many sockets do I hold against `host:port`?* —
//! so three profiles pointing at one Postgres box were three independent
//! budgets, and browsing databases inside each of them multiplied further.
//!
//! This module makes the **server endpoint** the unit of accounting. Every
//! pool that will really open connections first reserves capacity from its
//! endpoint's budget and holds an [`EndpointGrant`] for as long as it lives;
//! the grant releases on `Drop`, so no teardown path can leak one even if it
//! forgets to.
//!
//! # Admission control, not checkout interception
//!
//! The reservation is taken when a pool is **opened**, sized by that pool's
//! ceiling — not per connection checkout. Intercepting checkouts would mean
//! wrapping every `execute`/`fetch` in the command layer (hundreds of call
//! sites, each a chance to forget) and would still not bound what a pool is
//! *allowed* to grow to. Reserving the ceiling up front is coarser — a pool
//! that never fills holds budget it isn't using — but it yields a real
//! guarantee that is easy to reason about and impossible to bypass:
//!
//! > HuginnDB never has more than `budget` connections' worth of pool capacity
//! > open against one server, no matter how many profiles or database views
//! > point at it.
//!
//! The slack is bounded by the same thing that bounds everything else here:
//! pools are small ([`crate::db::pool`]) and idle ones are reaped
//! ([`crate::pool_reaper`]).
//!
//! # What is *not* one endpoint
//!
//! * **SQLite** has no server and no limit — [`EndpointKey::for_profile`]
//!   returns `None` and those pools are never metered.
//! * **A Mongo per-database view** reuses its parent's `Client`
//!   (`resolve_mongo_database_view`) and opens nothing, so it takes no grant.
//! * **Two profiles behind different SSH tunnels** are different endpoints
//!   even when both name `localhost:5432`, because each tunnel's remote is
//!   resolved relative to its own SSH host. The tunnel's `(host, port)` is
//!   therefore part of the key.
//!
//! Conversely, the username is deliberately **not** part of the key: the
//! server's limit is global, so two profiles connecting as different users are
//! still competing for the same pool of slots.
