//! SSH-tunnel support for server-backed connections.
//!
//! Given an [`SshTunnel`] config and a secret (password or private-key
//! passphrase), [`open_tunnel`] establishes an SSH session, binds a local
//! TCP listener, and proxies every accepted socket through an SSH
//! `direct-tcpip` channel pointing at `(remote_host, remote_port)`.
//!
//! The returned [`SshTunnelHandle`] owns:
//!
//! * the bound local port (which may differ from the configured one when
//!   the user asks for `0` / auto-assign),
//! * a [`CancellationToken`] that, when triggered (or when the handle is
//!   dropped), stops the accept loop and tears the listener down.
//!
//! ### Host-key verification
//!
//! The first thing the SSH handshake does is hand us the server's public
//! key. We compare its SHA-256 fingerprint against
//! [`crate::ssh_known_hosts`] using the policy on the tunnel config:
//!
//! * [`HostKeyPolicy::Strict`]     — only accept a fingerprint that
//!   matches a previously stored entry. Reject unknown servers.
//! * [`HostKeyPolicy::AcceptNew`]  — trust on first use: accept and
//!   persist new fingerprints, reject mismatches afterwards. Same model
//!   as `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new`. Recommended default.
//! * [`HostKeyPolicy::AcceptAny`]  — accept anything. Offers no MITM
//!   protection; only useful for throwaway test setups.
//!
//! When the handler decides to reject, `russh` short-circuits the
//! handshake with a generic error. We stash a richer human-readable
//! reason in a shared cell and substitute it on the way out so the user
//! actually sees what happened.
