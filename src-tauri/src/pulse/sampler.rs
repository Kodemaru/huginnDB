//! The 60-second (by default) background tick that turns [`super::store`]
//! from an empty file into a history.
//!
//! Mirrors `pool_reaper.rs`'s shape deliberately — same
//! `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` (not `tokio::spawn`; `setup` is not inside a
//! tokio reactor context), same "read what's needed under a short lock,
//! release it, then do the actual I/O" discipline, same split between the
//! loop and a directly-testable `tick`. The two differ in what a tick means
//! to fail at: a missed reap just leaves a pool open a little longer, while a
//! missed sample is a permanent gap in someone's history — so `tick` never
//! lets one connection's failure (a dropped server, a revoked privilege)
//! cost every other connection its sample for that minute.
